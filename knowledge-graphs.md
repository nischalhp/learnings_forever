# Knowledge Graphs

- [ ] Use cases
  - [ ] Social network
    - [ ] Link prediction
      - [ ] Small world Effect 
        - [ ] Every one is connected to everybody with very little direct hops
        - [ ] Sub graphs based on small world
      - [ ] scle free Effect
        - [ ] Only a few nodes have a lot of links, usually nodes are quite small
        - [ ] Nodes that have a lot of links control the graphs, they are called hinge nodes
      - [ ] Clustering effect
        - [ ] Groups have sub groups where all the nodes are linked to each other
      - [ ] Graph distance
        - [ ] Similarity Metrics
        - [ ] Small world effect used rather than Djikstra algorithm for graphs with millions of nodes
